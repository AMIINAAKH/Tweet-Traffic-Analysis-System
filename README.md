***Tweet Traffic Analysis System***
**Description**

This project leverages Twitter data for real-time road traffic event detection using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes tweets to classify them into traffic-related or non-traffic-related categories, providing valuable insights for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

**Key Features**

Data Processing: Preprocessing and cleaning Twitter data for optimal analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and BERT for tweet classification.
Results: Achieved up to 98.8% accuracy with the BERT model.
Applications: Enables real-time traffic monitoring and predictive analytics for efficient urban traffic management.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib
Models: Naive Bayes, CNN, BERT
Data Source: Twitter API
Future Work

Integration with GPS and sensor data for enhanced predictions.
Development of a centralized platform for real-time traffic management and alerts.
